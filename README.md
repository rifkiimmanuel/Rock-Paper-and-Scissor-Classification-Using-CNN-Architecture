# Rock-Paper-and-Scissor-Classification-Using-CNN-Architecture
This is the final project of the class “Learning Basic Machine Learning” by dicoding. 
This project involves image classification (Rock, Paper and Scissor) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  which is a type of Deep Learning neural network architecture.
Which can recognize rock, paper and scissor based on hand gestures.

About this project: 
1. Dataset is divided into train set and validation set. With criteria of the validation set size should be 40% of the total dataset (training data has 1314 samples, and validation data has 874 samples).
2. Implement image augmentation.
3. Using image data generator
4. This project uses a sequential model.
5. the model does not exceed 30 minutes.
6. Can predict images uploaded to Colab.
7. Accuracy: 0.9625

Library used: 
1. Tensorflow 
2. os Library
3. Zipfile library
4. Matplotlib.pyplot 
5. Numpy
6. Files library from google colab
7. Keras
